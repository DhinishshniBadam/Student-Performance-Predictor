# Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

# Dataset

The dataset is taken from a public student performance dataset (included in the repo as `StudentsPerformance.csv`).

# Features

- Data cleaning and transformation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training using Linear Regression
- Evaluation using Mean Squared Error and RÂ² Score
- Visualization of actual vs predicted scores
- Predicting score for a new student

# How to Run
